While it's essential to listen to these cues, it's also wise to proactively hydrate, especially in hot weather or during intense physical activity. Urine color can serve as a helpful indicator: pale yellow is generally a good sign of adequate hydration, while darker urine may suggest the need for increased fluid intake."
